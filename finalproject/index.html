      <div class="story_copy">

      <p>Mental health has never been as prominent as it is today. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=mental%20health" target="_blank"> Google trends</a> data shows that searches for mental health-related topics have increased steadily since 2004, universities across the country have begun to implement mental health days and, more than ever before, people are speaking openly about stress, anxiety, and mental illness. Despite this, mental health services remain shrouded by barriers limiting access to resources and support.</p>

      <p>When reached for comment, New York State Office of Mental Health’s Public Information Officer Mark Genovese indicated one of the state’s most prominent barriers to mental health care was a “lack of culturally appropriate care.” The services provided by the state’s mental healthcare system are met with continued “unfamiliarity” from community members in how to properly access and utilize them, with “long waiting lists to access mental health supports.”</p>

      <p>Figures within the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Patient-Characteristics-Survey-PCS-2022-Persons-Se/w8eu-45mn" target="_blank"> New York State Office of Mental Health’s 2022 “Patient Characteristics Survey”</a> further back this notion up. Data shows there remains a gap between financial ability and receiving mental health coverage, with 72% of the state’s patients seeking treatment being unemployed in some capacity.</p>
 
 <div class="container-fluid">

      <iframe title="Mental Health On and Off the Clock" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-0arH6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0arH6/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="548" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div></div>

      <p>Genovese mentioned that the lack of appropriate care for state communities reveals itself in the disparity of care between different employment levels. A vast majority of those unemployed or not in the labor force end up in residential or inpatient care. While those services and care are valuable, they are also much more intrusive, with the state’s <a href="https://my.omh.ny.gov/bi/pd/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FMental%20Health%20Program%20Directory%2F_portal%2FMental%20Health%20Program%20Directory&nquser=BI_Guest&nqpassword=Public123#metric" target="_blank"> Office of Mental Health</a> labeling these services as “24-hour care,” in which patients are often under supervision and support for an extended period of time.</p>

      <p>For those who may be unemployed within the state, this could mean more time without the ability to find a job or receive income. As such, even when patients get the mental healthcare they need, the type of service provided may further enable their place within the system itself.</p>

      <p>Without appropriate knowledge of the mental health care system and situation-specific care, these underprivileged patient groups find themselves overrepresented in data figures. Additionally, other barriers remain, limiting access to adequate mental health care for many in these situations.</p>

      <p>Genovese admitted on behalf of the state office that language access remained a prominent obstacle to accessing mental health treatment within the state. According to a <a href="https://my.visme.co/v/dmykyeyk-11e60m" target="_blank"> 2022 Mental Health Equity Report</a> conducted by the state Office of Mental Health, “approximately 2.5 million New Yorkers speak a language other than English as their primary language and have limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English.”</p>

      <p>The language gap remains a point of emphasis for the state, with the same report mentioning that such obstacles can “lead to lack of patient satisfaction and overall health disparities.” For already marginalized communities, this could add to the stigma surrounding seeking mental health care and another hurdle to finding representative and comfortable care within the system. While there is a push to hire more representative bilingual and multilingual providers, such limitations could prevent some within the state from seeking care altogether or being stuck within the system, unable to receive adequate care.</p>

  “Approximately 2.5 million New Yorkers speak a language other than English as their primary language and have limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English.”
</div>

      <p>Beyond employment status and language access, financial access, in general, prevents another section of the population from seeking mental health care.</p>

      <p>Findings from the same patient characteristics data reveal that as little as 5% of those seeking mental health services within New York are uninsured. Of this, the White population is, on average, the least likely to be uninsured, with 4.02% of white people seeking treatment being uninsured. This is in comparison to minority race populations, who routinely had higher percentages of uninsured patients. For example, in Central New York, 20% of the Black patient population is uninsured compared to a state average of 7.07%.</p>

      <iframe title="No Insurance, No Service" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-592lW" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/592lW/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="448" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div></div>

      <p>Without insurance coverage, mental health treatment can prove unattainable for many. Psychiatrist visits alone, for instance, can cost hundreds of dollars for those who are uninsured, according to <a href="https://www.aetna.com/" target="_blank">Aetna coverage details.</a> That is on top of the costs of any medication or further treatment needed for mental health-related conditions.</p>

      <p>The fact that the data represents region-specific differences in insurance coverage figures further represents the barriers to culturally appropriate care Genovese referenced. While progress has been made to expand services and access, insurance coverage remains a significant impediment, especially in communities that are underfunded, underrepresented, and cannot afford the extra costs and time needed to dedicate to receiving mental health care.</p>

      <p>With only 5% of the representative patient pool being uninsured, it further signifies the high costs of accessing mental health treatment. While Genovese referenced many initiatives within the system to improve care, such as “increased language access translations” and “efforts to diversify the mental health workforce,” there is a lack of specific actions being done to promote financial accessibility in patient outreach.</p>

      <p>That being said, mental health care, in general, has seen continued recognition and financial support within the state of New York over the past years. <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-33-million-expand-mental-health-services-youth" target="_blank">New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced</a> a 3.3-million-dollar commitment to expand mental health services for children within the state in 2022, and steps are being taken to expand diverse coverage within the state.</p>

      <p>However, even with an added focus on mental health funding and support, steps are still needed to properly expand coverage to be accessible to all state community members. Despite the unprecedented efforts to expand mental health care to the public prominence it holds today, progress is a continued necessity to ensure that all marginalized groups get the care they need regardless of employment status, language capabilities, or financial ability.</p>
